## Background

Grouper aquaculture, the cultivation and breeding of groupers, is a lucrative activity in Indonesia. The demand for grouper fish is high both locally and internationally, making it a promising business (Annur, 2021). However, this industry comes with significant risks such as fish theft and mass fish mortality due to unfavorable environmental conditions.

To address these challenges, an effective monitoring technology for floating cage systems is essential. Currently, many grouper aquaculture businesses rely on conventional monitoring methods, such as hiring individuals to periodically inspect cage conditions during the night before harvesting. This approach consumes time, energy, and incurs additional costs, making it less effective in addressing the mentioned issues.

In response to these challenges, we present NetFarms: a prototype monitoring system for floating cages based on LoRa (Long Range) technology. NetFarms includes theft detection features using laser and LDR sensors combined with a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor. LoRa is a wireless technology that enables data transmission over long distances with low power consumption.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** NetFarms allows grouper aquaculture entrepreneurs to monitor cage conditions in real-time through a dedicated smartphone or computer application.

- **Theft Detection:** The system includes a theft detection feature that sends immediate notifications to aquaculture entrepreneurs if any suspicious activities are detected around the cages, enabling prompt preventive actions.

- **Water Compatibility Monitoring:** NetFarms is equipped with a system to monitor water suitability for grouper growth, supporting the overall growth process (Yuspita, et al., 2022).

## How NetFarms Works

The NetFarms system operates by integrating LoRa technology, laser and LDR sensors, and a PIR sensor. This combination enables efficient monitoring of floating cages, providing real-time data on cage conditions, and detecting potential theft or other security issues.
